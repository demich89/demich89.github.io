      I’m a Network DevOps Engineer with a strong background in networking and automation. I’ve worked across diverse technical domains, specializing in routing, infrastructure engineering, and scalable systems. I focus on connecting traditional networking with modern software practices to deliver automated, reliable, and efficient infrastructure.
      Currently, I’m advancing network automation and process optimization through scripting and DevOps tooling — simplifying complex environments and enabling faster, more innovative operations across the organization.

              Automate were possible, lab everything first before production. Working on a daily base with Python and Terraform
              to automate network deployments and configurations.

              At [Routz Group](https://www.routz.nl), I started to work as a Network Engineer for various clients

              Same company [VodafoneZiggo](https://www.vodafoneziggo.nl) but a switch to the service design team.
              Here I worked on the design and implementation for Voice and also an Azure solution.

              The merger was a fact for [VodafoneZiggo](https://www.VodafoneZiggo.nl), and I did some extra projects 
              to write LLD for project like replacement of probe routers from the core and management.

              My first assignment [Vodafone NL](https://www.vodafone.nl), I started with the data engineer team.
              Made a hugo jump into MPLS and BGP routing. Amazing time and started my first automation with Python
              for the deployment of repetitive tasks.
              Worked with Cisco, Huawei, Fortinet, F5 and several smaller CPE.

              At [Simac ICT](https://www.simac.com), Ran the network side of a private cloud before “cloud” was cool. 
              Nexus, Netscaler, ASA, DMVPN — if it blinked and had an IP, I made it work. 
              Automated repetitive tasks with Excel (had I only known better than).

              I worked on migrations and upgrades involving Exchange, VMware, and network infrastructure. 
              I provided both server and client-level support to small and medium business customers, 
              ensuring smooth transitions and minimal downtime. Too much small jobs and repetitive tasks
              so decided to move for a real network engineer job.

              Realized that instead of delivering news papers as a job, I could deliver digital packets and got

              holidays and after school work.

          I spent countless hours in the labs and eventually began virtualizing network equipment using VMware ESX. VIRL was my starting point into network simulation. 
          I graduated with a 9 on my final thesis about implementing IPv6 for the university network — which, ironically, is probably still running IPv4 today. ;)

          That’s when I realized school could actually be fun — and that your hobby can become a career. 
          MS-DOS was still popular and hands-on labs were the default. 
          I was constantly moving between machines, carrying hard drives and network cables.
